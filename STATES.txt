RalstonAI holds only a few states

-At the start of the game the turret begins to spin (scan function) and the engine decides on a random target (move Target)

-If the cannon notices an enemy it fires until it no longer sees them ( does not stop spinning) ( fire function )

-After firing the state technically returns to scan for a tick 

-If the engine reaches its destination it picks a new spot and starts heading for that instead

-If the engine runs into a wall (aka it stops moving) a counter starts
	- If that counter hits a set value the engine sets a new random target
